*Simon.ino* is a Shield for Arduino Uno inspired by the SIMON DICE (Simon Says) color memorization game.

It is a printed circuit board `PCB` designed and originally intended as a student project so that young people have a simple base with lights, buttons a small` I2C` screen and `Bluetooth` connection with which to work easily playing with the different platforms like [`Arduino IDE`](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [` ArduinoBlocks`](http://www.arduinoblocks.com/) and the like.

**Attention:** This Project is under development, updates will be uploaded little by little. Thanks for your understanding.
