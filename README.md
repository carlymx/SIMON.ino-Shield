Simon.ino is an open source prototyping circuit board `PCB` aimed to students and beginners alike. The shield
has build in LEDs, push buttons, a small OLED display and `Bluetooth` connectivity, which makes it an attractive
base to learn microcontroller programming (electronics-programming interaction). Simon.ino can be programmed
in form of Blocks (for beginners, such as young students) or the native Arduino IDE (Integral Development Environment), which is a subset of the popular C++, for more advance learners.

[`Arduino IDE`] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or  
[` ArduinoBlocks`] (http://www.arduinoblocks.com/) and the like.

Simon.ino can be used by teachers at schools to promote [S.T.E.M.] subjects (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics), as well as at home.
